# Telephone Number Validator

Includes two JavaScript solutions for validating US phone numbers using regular expressions.  
The first is a lightweight one-liner, while the second is easier to understand and keeps the logic clear.

Created as part of the *JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures* certification challenge.  
Feel free to use or adapt this code, but I strongly encourage writing your own version to fully grasp the concepts and learn effectively.
